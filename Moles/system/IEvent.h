 * IEvent defines an interface for game engine's event. The engine is

 * engine's subsystems, actors, processes and the like.
 * @par This interface defines the very least method an event must have. Those
 * are:
 * @par type: An unique identifier for an event. Event receivers may check this
 * to know what to do.
 * @par timestamp: It gives an indication about when the event have been 
 * created.
