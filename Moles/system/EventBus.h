/**
 * The EventBus manages message delivering and message listeners subscription.
 * To do this the class defines some concepts:
 * @par Listener registration: objects implementing EventBusDelegate protocol 
 * can be registered as listener for a specific type of messages. From then
 * on the listener is invoked whenever a message of that specific type is sent
 * around.
 * @par Event queuing: objects implementing IEvent interface may be put in a
 * queue, waiting for future dispatching. The standard EventBus implementation
 * sends queued events when update message is invoked.
 * @par Instant event: an event may be sent immediately to listeners. Sometimes
 * it makes sense to do that, but the standard method should be event queuing.
 * @note The engine uses a default instance, but users may instances as many
 * message buses as they see fit. Different instances will not share event
 * queues, nor events listeners.
